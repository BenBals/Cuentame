# Cuentame

We had to make a game for our spanish lessons so this is what we came up with.

## The concept
One of the players is the writer in each round. The writer gets a location in Colombia and some infos in German. Based on that he has to describe it in Spansish. When he's done the other players get his description and have to find the location on the map. They get points based on the distance to the right location. Who has the most points in the end wins.
